# ChessSharp Project 3 of 3

Continuing on the .NET based Chess application, project 3 includes: loading assemblies of other games via reflection at runtime, a minimax AI with Alpha/Beta pruning, and small UI improvements. This section of ChessSharp was completed with a partner, Johnathan Nuno, using his version of the second project as a base.
